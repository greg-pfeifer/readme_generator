# Readme Generator

## Description

This project was completed for the purpose of creating a readme generator. Using the command line and Node JS, a user can respond to prompts detailing each section of a readme. The application then generates a readme file based on the user's input.   

## Usage

As seen in the demnostration video, the user types "node index.js" to initialize the application and then follows the prompts to fill in the information for each section of the readme. Since this is a command-line application, Github deployment is not applicable to the application.
